I want to create the backend of the company profile recruitment using express.js, supabase, postgresql, prisma orm and typescript.
Can you create the model first there is 2 role admin and user. User can register and also update their profile update the certificate too and also can apply the job.
Admin can see all the applied job.


# Connect to Supabase via connection pooling
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.dbshklltymmrdhhovegb:batara123@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Direct connection to the database. Used for migrations
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.dbshklltymmrdhhovegb:batara123@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
